# Transactions and Instructions in Solana

## Token Launchpad
A `Token Launchpad` (also known as a IDO Platform or Token Launch Platform) is a platform designed to help blockchain projects raise funds and distribute their tokens to early investors. These platforms provide a structured way for new crypto projects to launch their tokens while offering investors early access to promising opportunities.

## Instructions
An **instruction** is the fundamental operational unit in Solana that represents:
- A single command to be executed by a program (smart contract)
- The specific accounts that will be accessed
- The data payload containing parameters for the operation



## Transactions
A **transaction** is a bundle of:
- 1 or more instructions (up to the size limit)
- Recent blockhash (for expiration control)
- List of required signatures
- Fee payer information


## Key Differences

| Feature        | Instruction                     | Transaction                      |
|---------------|---------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| **Purpose**   | Single operation                | Batch of operations              |
| **Atomicity** | Part of transaction             | All succeed or fail (atomic)     |
| **Size limit**| N/A                             | 1232 bytes (max)                 |
| **Fee**       | N/A                             | Paid per transaction             |
| **Lifetime**  | N/A                             | Expires after ~2 minutes         |
| **Signatures**| N/A                             | Requires 1+ signatures           |

## Transaction vs Instruction

**Transactions**: In blockchain, a transaction is a record of an action, like transferring tokens from one wallet to another. It gets added to the blockchain as a block after being validated.

**Instructions**: These are the commands that tell the blockchain what to do, like "send 5 tokens from Wallet A to Wallet B." They are part of the process that creates a transaction.

### In simple, When you send a transaction to the solana blockchain, you are actually sending a bunch of instructions (with a limit to the max number of instructions you can send)

## Token mint
Itâ€™s like a bank that has the athority to create more coins. It can also have the authority to freeze coins.

## What is Polyfill?
`Polyfill` (or polyfiller) is a piece of code `(usually JavaScript)` that provides `modern functionality to older browsers` that do not support it natively. The term comes from the idea of `"filling in"` gaps in a browser's capabilities.

### Why Use Polyfills?

- **Ensures backward compatibility** for websites/apps.
- **Allows developers to use modern web APIs** (e.g., `fetch()`, `Promise`, `Array.includes()`) in older browsers like **Internet Explorer**.
- **Helps maintain a consistent user experience** across different browsers.
