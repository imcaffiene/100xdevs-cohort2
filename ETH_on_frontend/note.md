## Wallets in ETH

#### `Wallets are tools that allow users to store, manage, and interact with their cryptocurrencies. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the key concepts`

1. **Types of Wallets**:

   - **Hot Wallets**: Connected to the internet, suitable for daily transactions (e.g., MetaMask).
   - **Cold Wallets**: Offline storage, more secure for long-term holding (e.g., Ledger, Trezor).

2. **Private Keys**:
   - **Definition**: A private key is a secret number that allows you to access and manage your cryptocurrencies.
   - **Importance**: Losing your private key means losing access to your funds.
   - **Security**: Never share your private key; it should be kept secure and offline.
3. **Public Keys**:
   - **Definition**: A public key is derived from the private key and is used to generate your wallet address.
   - **Function**: It allows others to send you cryptocurrencies without revealing your private key.
   - **Visibility**: Public keys can be shared freely, as they do not provide access to your funds.
4. **Wallet Addresses**:
   - **Definition**: A wallet address is a hashed version of your public key, often represented as a string of alphanumeric characters.
   - **Usage**: It is used to receive cryptocurrencies from others.
   - **Format**: Different cryptocurrencies have different address formats (e.g., Ethereum addresses start with '0x').
5. **Seed Phrases**:
   - **Definition**: A seed phrase is a series of words that can be used to recover your wallet.
   - **Function**: It is a human-readable representation of your private key and can restore access to your wallet if lost.
   - **Security**: Like private keys, seed phrases should be kept secure and never shared with anyone.
